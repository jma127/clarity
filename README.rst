Clarity for Glass
=================

Developed for Google Glass, Clarity is an app that provides presenters notes and
slide previews on demand, as well as gesture-based presentation control. The app
links to a server which facilitates communication between the presentation view
and Glass view. This functionality allows for a more natural and intuitive
presenter experience.

The app is currently limited to public Google Drive presentations.

Developed at the Signalfire Hackathon (September 2013), earning first place.
